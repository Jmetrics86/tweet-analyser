# Examples

## Description

Here are some examples of what I've used tweet-analyser to do. They are mostly joke examples of
what I find interesting and how tweet-analyser can help you perform an analysis of something you
may have little pre-existing knowledge of, and take you down a path of exploration.

## Where Do I Start

Start with the [@PrepareToTry exploration](@PrepareToTry/@PrepareToTry.md) as everything else
branches of of this. It's the most detailed one and explains some of the working going on in
the background that has enabled us to do our analysis. From there you can look at any other
examples as these are shorter and concern themselves with only the result, not how we got there.
